# Task5
In this task, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
We explored the data structure, handled missing values, identified outliers, and visualized feature relationships through histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, pairplots, and heatmaps.
Observations and insights were drawn based on these visualizations to understand patterns, trends, and anomalies within the dataset.
